# Data Analyst Portofolio

Hello!

My name is Satria, i'm an Informatics Engineering Fresh Graduate at Gunadarma University with a strong passion for Data Analytics. Through teamwork and hands-on projects, I’ve gained valuable experience in analyzing data and solving real-world problems. I have a keen interest in data analysis and continuously expand my skills by exploring various tools, learning new technologies, and staying up-to-date with industry trends.

This portfolio showcases a collection of data projects that highlight both my technical expertise and analytical skills. Here, you’ll find documents, dashboards, and presentation materials created using SQL, Tableau, Excel, and PowerPoint. Each project reflects my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize data in a way that is both insightful and easy to interpret.
